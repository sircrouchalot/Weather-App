# Weather-App

## Description
My app reads a user input of a city, and returns current weather values, and a future 5 day forecast.

However, if the user inputs a state with a space between the city and state (New York, NY), the query fails. 

I couldn't figure out how to use the UV Index API in conjunction with the current weather API and forecast API, so the current weather does not display the UV Index.

I also could not get the buttons on the sidebar to save in localStorage. However, all of the other functionality of the site remains.
